Features

Simulates prey and predator interactions with age, breeding, and movement behaviors.
Visual representation of the simulation using Java Swing.
Dynamic graph displaying population changes of prey and predators over time.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/diegocico/predadorpreysim.git
cd animal-simulation

Compile the Java files:

javac *.java

Run the simulation:

java Main

Usage

After running the simulation, a window will open displaying the simulation area and the graph. Prey are represented by green circles, and predators are represented by red circles. The graph updates in real-time to show the population changes.
